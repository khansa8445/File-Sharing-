# File-Sharing Integration Test Innovators - Automation Testing 🚀

## 📌 Project Title: **File-Sharing**

### 🏆 Introduction
🛍️ File Sharing 
This is a secure file-sharing web application that allows users to upload files, protect them with passwords, and share them via downloadable links. Built with React and Node.js, the app offers a smooth and responsive user experience along with backend file handling and authentication features.

**✨ Essential Features of the File Sharing App**

**🔐 User Authentication**

Sign Up & Login functionality using JWT tokens for session management.

Protected routes accessible only after successful login.

**📤 File Upload**

Upload files from your local system.

Files are stored securely on the server.

**🔗 File Sharing via Link**

After upload, a unique download link is generated for each file.

Users can copy and share the link with others.

**🔒 Password Protection for Files**

Optional password protection to restrict file access.

Recipients must enter the correct password to download the file.

**📁 File Management Dashboard**

Logged-in users can view a list of all uploaded files.

Ability to copy links, update file settings, or delete files

This test plan outlines the **manual and automation testing** strategy to ensure that all functionalities operate as intended, providing a **user-friendly** and **high-performance** experience across various devices and browsers. 🌍📱💻
